<p>Well you're at the right place. Heyudo is the one place to go when you need real things done. 
It's simple, just make a "post" for something you need done. It could be a lawn that needs to be mowed, a 
deck that needs to be built, or a Website that needs to be created.</p>
<p>Tell us the most you're willing to pay 
to have it done, and when you want to have the "bidding" done by. Then the people who can get the 
job done for you will compete for your business. No more phone books, no more phone tag, no more 
hassles.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>First, just login using the login box on the top of the page.</p>
<%= image_tag ("tut_login_box.png", :alt => "Login box image") %>
<p>Then click on the "create a post" button on the first page you see after you login.</p>
<%= image_tag ("tut_create_post.png", :alt => "Create a post image") %>
<p>Then just fill out the form, click the button, and wait for the offers to roll in!</p>
<%= image_tag ("tut_create_post_form", :alt => "Create a post image")%>
<p>Viola! That's it! Now you just sit back, relax, and let them fight over who will give you the 
best deal. Don't forget, if you have a special skill, and feel like becoming insanely wealthy
you can also search for posts from your dashboard (that's the first page you see when you log in).</p>
